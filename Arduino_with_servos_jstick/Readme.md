#
#### STEPS:
- - #### build Arduino circuit with four servo motors 
- - #### program all servos to start at 90 as the initial position (except base)
- - #### control servos by A changing resistance (joystick)
#### Parts:
- - #### Four Servo Motors: 
 ###### "base" servo mg995, "shoulder" servo mg995, "elbow" servo mg995, "wrist" servo g9
- - #### Joystick: 
 ###### simple joystick, comes with the Arduino kit connected to the A0 and A1 as 'y' and 'x' axis
