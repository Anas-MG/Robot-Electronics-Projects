## Arduino circuit for Controlling Four servos , Two with joystick 
###### this is the first project in order to complete 
## Setup:
 #### Servos: 
- - ###### "base" servo mg995, "shoulder" servo mg995, "elbow" servo mg995, "wrist" servo g9
 #### Joystick: 
- - ###### simple joystick, comes with the Arduino kit connected to the A0 and A1 as 'y' and 'x' axis

- #### There are three "mg995" servos , One "9g" servo that I assumed it to be the wrist

#### Files:
- #### joystick_control_Recording.mp4
 > ##### Recording for controlling the (shoulder & elbow ) servos with joystick
- #### servo_jstick
> ##### contains the main sketch that i've wrote to program the servos to 90 degrees (except base), and to control (elbow & shoulder) servos with joystick
